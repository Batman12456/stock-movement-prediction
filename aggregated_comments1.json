            "That same argument would have prevented you from investing in TSLA at an early stage I agree that both are a speculative investment and a lot of things need to go right in order for plans to materialize regulatory execution cost etc but I think a lot of that is currently priced into the market As they begin to hit milestones as the regulatory environment continues to become more favorable and as they execute there will be a capitulation of investors buying in at the opportunity if successful Its all a matter of riskreward at this stage",

            "Im so sorry EDIT I take it backat first this read like a tragic tale but after becoming oddly concerned that some stranger out there is a moral monster I realized that I think youre trolling us at least in this position idk your other postsa quick glance at the options tree on tesla indicates that youre basically breaking even right now probably if tesla rides up from here I think you actually made moneybut its scary from the outside due to just seeing the large negative numbers referencing how much to get out of your cash secured put that you sold lolololol brilliantly done Sir Coq of Coqs",
            "Hes literally with CSPs You dont lose money on those ffs He sold puts ATM the money and is going to get assigned shares of Tesla at share Hes paying a premium for them compared to buying the shares at market right now but hes not losing money Tesla isnt going to go bankrupt anytime soon lol Really not a big deal Especially when Tesla will likely run right back over that cost basis in the near future",

            "Why would she abort him when you consider with the premium he collected on his cash secured put its likely he actually made some money off of this trade lol If you did this same position today youd get over per trade and your break even would be which we are hovering around and the option expires Fridayhe probably got even more premium for this and worst case scenario he owns a bunch of tesla at a pop after getting paid a fat wad of premium If Tesla goes up from here its likley he actually made decent cheese",
            "The setup for this trade was just asking for trouble even without hindsight Your max gain was easily capped if it happened to sustain and it wasnt just going to hover around On the plus side its TSLA and the price might go up towards it again in the next weeks since its basically a meme stock Or it could drop like a rock below and erase your k gain",
            "He is losing money temporarily He will be assigned the shares at the strike So if it comes back up its all good Same as if he just bought Tesla when it was at but he gets all the premium when its assigned",

            "Rivian is like a regarded red headed step cousin to Tesla I get it they are loosing money to gain market share but theyve somehow increased their loss per vehicle by k from Q And it appears that they will not do much better after the Tariffs Just sayin",
            "You make a legit point The best example is TSLA runup before the many splits Several were doing similar selling far OTM strike calls only to be called away Buying c and selling c strikes thinking they wont get called away in a short time span Some were even doing this with naked calls no offsetting strikes In the event it runs to or near the OTM strike the brokerage will close your position or lock your account if you dont address In OPs situation he is golden c vs c is called timing",
            "Made k off of tesla couple weeks ago but ok Keep projecting",

            "Ive been saying this for a couple of weeks and I think the problem is only going to grow The issue isnt with MSTR They came up with a pretty clever way of raising money The issue isnt even with the bond buyers as those notes are basically cheap call options The issue is going to be with copycats and yield chasing bond fund managers Youll have fund managers that will underperform if they dont have this type of exposure so theyll scoop some of these up This is round though What asset spawns the next convertible wave Things might go well for bit but then youll have some sort of failure where that paper gets nuked and the bond funds bond funds grandma and the Bogleheads are investing in for safety take heavy losses and the selling cascades Bond markets precede the stock market so its probably time for people in this sub to start watching it if you eventually want to time your puts",
            "Banks blew up in not because a bunch of their mortgages defaulted but because the risk of those mortgages defaulting had been mispriced The bundledmortgage bonds were much more volatile than what banks had hedged for and their hedges all got BTFO MSTR is a nakedly regarded play but the difference this time is that the big boys investing in it know its a nakedly regarded play Theyre just momentum trading it The Big Short is a cool movie and its frankly one of the cornerstones of this sub but you cant just copypaste its story to explain every parabolic price increase out there",
            "The Big Short the movie and its consequences have been a disaster for modern credit markets Collateralised Debt Obligation just means secured debt and MSTR while in my view a bad investment is a totally different situation for a start MSTR bonds arent even secured so your comparison falls at the first hurdle",
            "How is it different Well the mortgage bonds of the early s were based on the idea that the underlying asset real estate market mortgages would never fail The difference here is that MSTR is based on the idea that the underlying asset also wont fail except the asset is Bitcoin and not housing",

            "The bond holders would presumably be entitled to whatever the value was of the bitcoin holdings in the event of a default I believe the convertible bond holders are hedging their delta exposure to MSTR price with large short positions and playing a volatility trade Mark Meldrum has a good video on YouTube explaining the trade So overall unless bitcoin really goes to zero between the short hedge position and whatever salvage value there is in the bitcoin the bond holders would probably come away with a substantial portion of their investment or be made whole entirely The real suckers are the equity holders",

            "Its definitely not worse for the bondholders or Saylor the only one who can lose is the MSTR shareholder The bonds are collateralized with the bitcoin Microstrategy is diluting shareholders as well with straight equity offerings used to buy bitcoin This bitcoin is also collateral for the bondholders Since MSTR is doing a bonds and equity issuance to raise funds to buy bitcoin Microstrategy already has alot of BTC on its balance sheet from previous bonds they issued and prior capital raises this too is collateral for the bondholders Bitcoin would have to drop alot more then for those bondholders to get stiffed Shareholders being the lowest on the capital stack will be the only ones that arent made whole",
            "Right To make a housing market analogy were at the stage when mortgage lenders are able to fund homes on low equity in a rising market and then resell that debt to someone else which makes mortgage brokers looser with money which accellerates the buying frenzy which increases the price and the cycle continues Once we have multiple companies doing this with multiple coins well get funds targeted at investing in this debt in general that will create the equivalent of a CDO that will generate some sort of profit as long as someone is doing well Honestly the more I think about it this is what were going to get when this moves on to shitcoins Its definitely going to be the copycats like you said and well effectively have CDOs built with MSTR at the top and ETH DOGE SHIP TON equivalents making up the lower tranches",
            "Allianz just bought B in bonds from them to presumably add to its portfolio which would include normal peoples accounts or they will now have exposure to this shit Its proliferating at a rapid pace now The bonds were for insiders only so now some risk averse people probably unwittingly have crypto exposure in their portfolio by way of MSTR convertible bonds",
            "The bond buyers are playing the convexity of the options and playing the gamma game MSTR is buying Bitcoin with the money Bitcoin has negative Vanna As prices rises IV rises This is the only asset I have ever heard of that has negative vanna The gamma trade the bondholders are using rely on that factor to power the arbitrage between the bonds and selling the shares short The bondholders must increasingly short more shares of MSTR to cover over time This is a totally wild game and will end somewhere but MSTR has a lot of runway ahead of them on this",
            "Exactly The OP is a dimwit Bitcoin and MicroStrategy stock are fungible assets unlike real estate which lacks this characteristic The bonds issued by MicroStrategy are not rated AAA yet investors continue to buy them fully aware of the associated risks These are not CDOs as CDOs by definition consist of pooled debt instruments structured into various tranches In contrast MicroStrategy bonds are fungible at the time of issuance",

            "How are the equity holders suckers Everyone who owns MSTR shares understands its a levered BTC delta bet Bond holders are providing cheap leverage and get to play the gamma game but dont get the massive upside if BTC rips because theyre delta hedged Equity holders get cheap leverage massive upside if BTC goes up and massive downside of BTC goes down Seems like everyone is getting exactly what they signed up for",
            "Im not seeing how the note holders will get direct access to bitcoin MSTRs press release says that the notes are convertible for MSTR stock not bitcoin MSTR stock will likely never be converted to bitcoin The bankruptcy trustee would sell the bitcoin and distribute net assets to the shareholders years after MSTR falls apart",

            "a volatile asset that doesnt actually exist and has no intrinsic value as a currency thats only existed for a short time in the asset world is risky And it wont become a true systemic risk because well unless the people in multiple governments are really stupid they will realize that there is zero control of this asset in any way since its pure digital and we dont even know who the creator is which is a massive risk in and of itself For all we know the blockchain has an unexplored exploit Its not like gold that is mined and can be locked up in physical vaults when we had gold standards And its not like currency which has significant controls and trade surrounding it with hundreds of years of trust behind the concept Its super risky And its speculative Which is fine on the face of it since these kinds of assets always existed But to hit the level of systemic risk especially globally for an economy as big as that of the USA would require an extreme amount of stupid decision making and investment to get there And no one is gonna let it get that big This whole hypothetical youre discussing is just indicative of the mania bubble that bitcoin and MSTR are creating around it The other person is probably right Its not bitcoin its the fact that this kind of shell game can be played with it through bonds and what other money managers might do to approximate this level of growth through the same strategy on an increasingly large number of random shit being used to justify it",

            "I agree that this mindset of bond funds playing shell games to buy notbonds is the kind of thing thats eventually going to get those funds blown up and movies made Continued moves like this could grow into unpriced risk on the part of the bond traders when theyve got junk on their books that is riskier than their conservative investors assume I just dont see MSTR as the play thatll bring everything down because its limited in size and its a pretty routine volatility trade",
            "I liked your post Also lived through it and read devoured the book I think the parallels are significant especially if we start to see other coins start occupying the lower tranches with MSTR being the first of many It may also get harder to avoid these investments in the future as firms that arent coin pure plays follow this model as a side hustle to their main business but adding a ton of risk in the process once it implodes And this time bonds wont be a safe haven in theres contagion",
            "Money spent to buy BTC MSTR or anything else on this planet always ends up in someone elses pocket That someone will go and presumably buy something else or they will deposit it buy bonds etc and yet another someone will do something with it and so on Then it really depends on where this merrygoround ends someone decides to do nothing with the money anymore Money does not really get tied up or soaked up by just trading stuff up in price BTC can therefore keep going up without any obvious physical limit other than running out of peoples willingness to buy it for even more What does get money tied up temporarily are margins and collaterals though That money needs to stay in an account at a clearing house a central bank account ultimately",
            "The notes are payable in dollars ar some point years from issue I think At issuance the bonds are convertible to stock in lieu of repayment So long as the stock goes up they keep getting converted As long as you believe MSTR is solvent this is a free call option MSTR claims to spend all this bond money on BTC So the question will be what happens if MSTR stock goes down for a long enough period Theyd have to liquidate BTC to repay bond holders The value of BTC is almost irrelevant to MSTR it is the value of their own stock that has to keep going up Assuming most or all bond holders have converted the risk is if they sell MSTR No new investors if price goes down but it is five years till MSTR has to pay off the bonds If MSTR was really smart they could just sell all the BTC while it is high invest in index funds and fuck off to an island as the bonds due would be a tiny slice especially after years of investment interest But so far MSTR keeps doubling down like a WSB degenerate I dont know how it will end exactly but I would bet it turns out there is some extremely dumb risks and a bunch of people are going to learn expensive lessons",
            "During a bankruptcy stock holders are the last in line though after the bond holders I assume MSTR does not have significant liabilities towards the government employees or suppliers which are the first in line There may be nothing left for equity owners to scavenge",
            "The debt is staged to mature at different times So BTC would have to crash and stay down for years which has never happened before But yeah it BTC dies so does MSTR obviously",
            "The mortgage fraud required LAYERS of fraudulent leverage built into a system of credit enhancement that depended on an accurate assesment of risk MSTRs a single entity taking a very straightforward risk Importantly leveraged owners of Bitcoin get wiped out but the pain doesnt spread beyond the individual owner because each bet doesnt prop up the next one Liquidation is painful but not contagious OP doesnt understand how MBS works or they would t have made the comparison",
            "If you buy Bitcoin and short a bit of MSTR as a hedge is that a good plan or stupid Like you dont know when the crash comes just that it will come So you gradually at to your MSTR short when they set a new ATH and on every dip you take a bit of profit Then after it suddenly crashes now you can sell your Bitcoin and then just ride out the short for a couple of years Then you dont lose to much on your Bitcoin when it suddenly crashes faster then you think it was going to And you dont need to be so worried about timing the selling of at the top which is impossible to predict",
            "Its a cult They dont even zoom out to Max timeline on the MSTR charts to ask what the fuck happened in and why did it go from to The big thing now is the company added Corn to its portfolio and somehow Saylor doesnt cook books anymore The stock traded sideways for years and then dude discovered corn We are at the peak before the fall and his hubris will be the downfall IM SELLING BILLS FOR he says on live TV",
            "MSTR holds the keys in theory but youd have to trust that all the coins will actually be recovered in a bankruptcy Its not like physically taking cars from a dealership or deeds to real estate Theres no mechanism to transfer bitcoin without consent which is why this collateral is effectively worthless",
            "Housing has underlying value Bitcoin does not I would also argue that MSTR has not crashed If it dropped to maybe but not at",
            "Which will be a massive problem for MSTR The whole thing only works if BTC goes up if it goes down the bond holders will just ask for their money back and MSTR will have to start selling BTC to cover it or issue more debt",
            "I wouldnt call it stupid For instance I have BTC and when it reached k I was looking for a way to hedge the gains shortterm a week or two due to massive sell order volume in order books from k Shorting MSTR when BTC got stuck for days would have been a smart move to protect the gains from all the BTC Id accumulated the past few years",
            "MSTR holds its BTC in a Coinbase account This can easily be seized by court order in a bankruptcy ruling compelling Coinbase to transfer these to a government wallet in the same fashion Silk Roads BTC funds were The OPs point stands its no different from physical assets being sold off",
            "The debt has a duration of around years Bitcoin has never had a drawdown that lasted that long Also MSTR can force convert the debt early if price goes up enough before the debt matures But yeah shareholders are betting that MSTR doesnt screw up its leverage",
            "I was thinking for a dollars of capital I do dollars Bitcoin at x and short MSTR dollars at x The thesis is that after Bitcoin goes wrong MSTR will crash at insane speeds So then if I dont properly DCA out of the Bitcoin on time I have a bonus with the MSTR short to make up for the lost profits And if the short goes wrong the Bitcoin profits should be able to more then cover the loss And if I do properly DCA out of Bitcoin then I make double bank on the crash Plus if you short MSTR during a bull market there is also some premiums you can get if you short with a perpetual",
            "I want to see that if BTC crashes hard and he has to repay debt worth more than the whole BTC NAV This is what he means when he says he is selling volatility and compares his company to an oil refinery He is selling to the bond holders upside into BTC with no downside other than the missed interest but these are companies that couldnt do anything useful with that money anyway so they pretty much have no downside and MSTR shareholders are taking all the downside risk because they will get zeroed if BTC crashes",
            "Dunno the math but if the math works out dont see the issue Just dont know how youd short MSTR for only",
            "I am just talking ratios capital in longing Bitcoin at x capital in shorting MSTR at x",
            "TLDDR for the regards Calls on MSTR MSTR is not for you brokies to get BTC You can max out your welfare cheque on BTC yourself MSTR is a way for bond funds who cant buy BTC directly to get exposure to BTC The bond market is about T so MSTR got a big pool of streaming cash to their strategy Dont short them in this bull market If you do please post your results here for entertaining purpose Thank you",
            "gain which is less for not having to use leverage seems like a compelling argument to buy MSTR Never bought MSTR but this seems like an argument for not against",
            "The reason to invest in MSTR over Bitcoin is when you cant invest in Bitcoin but you can invest in MSTR MSTR isnt overvalued its valued at what those players think bitcoins value is going towards When MSTRs premium starts tanking thats when you know the music is stopping and the btc bull run is ending",
            "Seeing as crypto is a staple and mainstay with most financial institutions embedding the product and reporting on it to a standardised framework I do expect crypto to remain and to be fully supported especially when the frameworks that govern how we all use financial markets prescribes that they must BTC will go up MSTR has enough smart people creating models to forecast these business cases Links to show the frameworks the banks must abide by on crypto asset class and reporting",
            "At what price of bitcoin do you see MSTR going completely tits up from margin calls and being completely underwater on their purchases",
            "Long Bitcoin x Short MSTR x capital division As long as BTC stays above K take profit on the MSTR dips try to reenter the short at every new ATH for MSTR If Bitcoin goes towards K in slowly DCA out use a bit of that money to ad to the short every MSTR pump day Then when the Bitcoin cycle is over again and MSTR starts dropping like a rock you ride out the short for at least year Also short in such a way that you can collect some premiums",
            "I think youre paying a fee owning MSTR considering you get balance sheet access to less BTC per dollar invested than just buying the coin Youre also paying about a performance fee as seen above in the return discrepancy",
            "Youre absolutely fkn wild if you think bond funds are the ones on the other side of this convertible loan business Itll absolutely be banks hedge funds who want to trade the volgamma And most likely so they can either short flat price or sell out the optionality which is worth much more than MSTR couldve borrowed cash to buy bitcoin at So Saylor is just selling your upside in his business via dilution to ensure that he doesnt have cash burn in the short term",
            "MSTR is using leverage Thats the whole point of the post They owned B in bitcoin on M of net assets",
            "Instead of using leverage on bitcoin use that same leverage on MSTR for even more leverage",
            "It is not possible for MSTR to ever own more bitcoin per dollar of market capitalization than you could buy with your own dollar at any given price",
            "When MSTR is mooning people just kept linking to Saylors youtube interview didnt watch it saying that it explains everything explains the price movements MSTR will be EOY People who think is overvalued simply doesnt understand Saylors vision bla bla bla insane lol",
            "absolutely Volgamma trades is part of this fun game so banks hedge funds are in on it too Heres an example of regulatory constraints which also applies to bond funds If youre an insurance company and you buy M of bitcoin you have to write M down off your balance sheet surplus Which impacts your reserve ratios Buy M of a MSTR convertible bonds take no write down and get Bitcoin exposure Then hedge this exposure with volgamma trades on MSTR This ponzilite scheme will have to end someday just not any time soon",
            "Nope they can both go to zero Kidding Its a genuine question The theory is MSTRs debt is long term so theyll have the time to wait for BTC to rebound before needing to pay it back An individual investor would just be wiped out by the leverage immediately if BTC dropped The reality is some of MSTRs debt is puttable meaning the bondholder can request the issuer to buy back the bond This provides downside protection if the bonds value decreases due to MSTR balance sheet weakness and MSTR would be required to sell BTC at the lows to meet this obligation There are still bonds with principal payments due over the next few years and MSTR does not have the cash to meet these payments today They bought BTC instead They would need to dilute or take out more debt and that would be very difficult in a crypto winter environment Theres risks to long MSTR that arent there with long leveraged BTC",
            "The latest evidence I can find says about every hours adding to a day which would be about a year Its based on the initial dollar value of the investment so if you bought BTC at k youd pay a year in fees But you ask a good question and I was really curious about how this impacts the hypothetical situation above so I did the math B BTC at x leverage is about B of bitcoin Youd pay about B in fees a year After years Dec to Dec you pay about B in fees This changes the final gain from about B to B a increase instead of which does significantly change the gain However youre still far ahead of the gain in MSTR over the same time period Hope this helped",
