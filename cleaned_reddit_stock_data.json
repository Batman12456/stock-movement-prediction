            "Yeah OKLO had a chance to get something approved a while back but when they were asked to submit additional papers they just ghosted Absolute train wreck I think NNE is actually going to outperform booth Rather than small modular reactors they use micro reactors which are even smaller I think theres a more likely to be feasible in the near future",
            "And my thesis is GEV has far more diversified revenue actually has revenue has agreements to build their BWRX in Canada and Poland which produces MWe compared to oklo to MWe not to mention GE is far more established so yeah those two may pump but GEV will be the ultimate winner",

            "A contract option is the right to buy shares of a stock So when you buy an option all youre doing is buying the right or option to buy shares of that stock at a set price It gives you leverage of shares without owning any The price you pay for the option is the premium Basically how much youre will to pay to have the right to buy shares I can bet that almost no one on WSB eventually gets those shares they wait until the premium for the right to buy those shares goes up and then sell those rights to someone else for profit Say stock B is currently we buy a call for months out with a strike price of Maybe we pay for the option Stock B eventually goes up to We currently have the right to buy shares at less than the current price So we would be able to make right now if we exercised and sold the shares but there is still month until it expires there will also be additional value added on due to the prospect that it could go up more There are different Greeks that will give you all the technical information of an option Delta will tell you how much the premium will increase for every move of the stock Say Delta is our stock went up total so our premium would have gone up or plus the additional premium from the prospect of it going up more So we bought the call for stock went up and that added more in value plus another for the prospect of it going up more We now sell it for to someone else who thinks it will go up more We x our money If we bought contracts to start our original investment would have been and we would have sold for Sorry if that doesnt answer your question there are a bunch of different things that go into it Delta Theta IV etc but the basics would be leverage of shares time until expiration and speculation of it going up or down plus what people are willing to pay for it One thing to be careful of is crazy high premiums an option could be selling for but only be valued at it all depends on what the seller sets a price for some do market value and some set it crazy high Always check what the bids are to make sure its not way over priced Other rules I try to follow are never play earnings You can make stupid BANK posts you see on here lmao but the chances are slim and Ive been burned too many times Netflix earnings a couple weeks ago both weekly calls and puts were down due to how things happened Also as I mentioned above I buy options months out Weeklies are cheaper because there is only a few days for the stock price to go up But stock market is crazy some times it can go up and down day by day if I believe a stock will go up in the long run it is just safer Example you could be right that price will go up in months but it dropped this week So the weekly call expired worthless you lost all your money instead of it going down a little and back up I look at it like this Longer calls investing strategy to take advantage of leverage weeklies gambling make a shit ton or nothing You can make money using both One is safer although you can lose all your money either way lmao if youre interested in them I would do more research than my half ass explanation They can be complicated and easy to get burned on But also are a great way to use leverage to make",

            "Maybe maybe not They like most options can be used to hedge a position To sell a put you earn a premium for saying you will buy the stock at a lower price You are saying you will buy at X price either hoping it never falls so you are bullish or you are temporarily bearish and want to take advantage of a dip You have a lot of potential losses though if there is dramatic downward pressure on the stock as you agreed at X price to buy it and the other side can force that trade It can work a bit as a short hedge if you short but sell a put you are getting paid even if the stock remains flat or positive If it rockets up this hedge still eats you alive though",
