And if it\u2019s taken you two years and you haven\u2019t been able to figure it out, it may not be for you. \n\nIf you really wanna learn, there are plenty of YouTube videos and your brokerage can probably help you through the process. \n\nBut to be safe you should just put your money in a high yield savings account or in an S&P index fund and stay far away from WSB lol. Again, no shade, just don\u2019t want you to lose the money chasing options if you don\u2019t understand them.",

            "My guy if you get fomo off WSB you need to get out asap. With stocks the worst that can happen is that your money goes to 0, with options (which loads of people do on here) you can get into serious debt. Don't touch them ever, it's fancy gambling but you can gamble money you don't have. \n\nJust congratulate those who're in the green and laugh at the ones throwing 700k at intel",

In fact some helicopters can go 1.5k+ miles before needing to be refueled and don\u2019t need giant expensive batteries.\n\nAlso, if there\u2019s already companies that do this then that means there\u2019s heavy competition to get into the space. Even more reason not to put money in.\n\nIm just stating facts on why I\u2019m not putting a dollar in. If you ride the wave a bit longer, congrats but I wouldn\u2019t trust this as an investment",

Is a 60mile range electric helicopter going to be cheaper to operate than a gas powered one with 20x the range?

After sucking up 230 mil in government funding, the project was deemed economically unviable and cancelled after Nuscale revised the project cost from $3.6 billion for 720 MWe of power generation to \\*\\*$9.3 billion for 4.62 MWe\\*\\* (forcing the company to \\*again\\* lay off the majority of its staff)\n* Nuscale is currently being sued in a class action lawsuit for materially misleading investors regarding the UAMPS fiasco\n\n$SMR has been working on this shit for \\*24 years\\* and they still have yet to manifest any material success. They should have been first to market by a wide and unambiguous margin, and instead find themselves neck and neck with $OKLO, $RYCEY and other leaner start-ups.",

The space is large enough for all of them; especially with the AI and Quantum boom that\u2019s only really just started.\n\nI like Oklo, it\u2019s the sexier company, and I invested way too much into this so that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this.",

            "Problem with this type of comparative analysis is that you\u2019re assuming NuScale is fairly valued, and not just a speculative stock that\u2019s seen multiple expansion due to hype in the nuclear industry.\n\nIt happened with pre-revenue dot-com internet companies in 2000, it happened with pre-revenue cannabis companies in 2018, it happened with pre-revenue EV companies in 2021, and now it\u2019s happening again with pre-revenue nuclear companies in 2024. It\u2019s literally just the same thing. Lots of hype and CGI renderings with no understanding of the difficulties to operate in the industry.\n\nPretty much every speculative name you see today with claims of being an \u201cindustry leader\u201d is just BS to pump their stock. Executives have already mostly cashed out of NuScale, and all of OKLO\u2019s management will have their options vest before the company ever sees any real generating revenue. They don\u2019t need the company to succeed, they just need to convince investors it will succeed for another few years.\n\nWhat will happen (and what always happens), is the timelines will continually be pushed back, valuations will drop like a rock, and these companies will all either go bust or have real industry leaders pick up their assets for pennies on the dollar. The real winners will be companies like Cameco and BWX who are supplying the industry, while names like Exxon or current utility providers likely transition to owning nuclear assets.",
            "It\u2019s at least the fourth time I\u2019ve read a DD about Oklo where one of the points is the presence of PhDs. What does it mean, and why do AIs keep repeating it?",
            "I bought a bunch of shares. I just wait for it to pop 5% to 10% during the day, then sell very short-dated covered calls at a strike that has a ton of outstanding contracts (currently around $25) - it inevitably drops, and I buy the CCs back, usually the same day. Heck, sometimes it's just a matter of hours. That way I can keep working my cost basis down to zero, so if all of this goes t\\*ts up, I will at least be net zero. And if it all works out, even better!\n\nTangent: Remember, generally retail buys options. Big $ sells options. And HFs don't make billions of dollars by paying out lottery tickets. It's the same reason NVDA is getting smashed despite insane revenue/profit/outlook. There are 100s of thousands of contracts that were sold at the $150 strike price. No way in hell are those getting paid off. But in a week or two, NVDA will start its climb again, because if you look at open interest, there are far fewer (comparatively speaking) contracts at that strike.\n\nEdit: Looking at open interest, Dec 27th is probably when OKLO (funny enough, also the same date for NVDA) is when they might start to break loose.",

As they begin to hit milestones, as the regulatory environment continues to become more favorable, and as they execute- there will be a capitulation of investors buying in at the opportunity if successful.

Putting aside that their design certification is for a plant that was found to not be economically viable, their customers will be required to do the heavy-lifting in order to complete the 24-36 month NRC review.

I think there's a more likely to be feasible in the near future.",

Extremely safe as far as options go. You could argue CCs are safer but given those cap your upside if assigned whereas assignment from a CSP that you wanted can go back up with the shares assigned, I would say it has better upside and in terms of financial appreciation is safer. The only thing you need to not do with a CSP is sell it on a company that is struggling financially/at the risk of bankruptcy. It's very easy not to sell a CSP on a shit (performance wise) company.",

            "NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has experienced significant volatility recently. As of November 28, 2024, the stock is trading at $135.34, reflecting a slight decline from the previous close.\n\nRecent Performance:\nOver the past week, NVDA\u2019s stock has declined by approximately 10%. This downturn follows an earnings report that, despite surpassing Wall Street expectations, did not fully satisfy investor anticipations. \ufffc\n\nEarnings and Outlook:\nIn its latest earnings report, NVIDIA reported a 94% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $35 billion, with a 112% surge in its data-center business driven by AI demand. However, the company\u2019s revenue forecast of $37.5 billion for the fourth quarter fell short of some expectations, contributing to the stock\u2019s recent decline. \ufffc\n\nAnalyst Perspectives:\nAnalysts maintain a positive outlook on NVIDIA.

            "Here\u2019s a ranking of options strategies for NVIDIA (NVDA), based on their potential effectiveness for various scenarios, starting with the most aggressive/high-reward strategies and ending with the most conservative/lower-risk approaches. The ranking assumes NVDA\u2019s recent volatility and AI-driven growth prospects:\n\n1. Long Call Options (Aggressive)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Bullish traders expecting a significant rise in NVDA stock price.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Buy calls at an out-of-the-money or slightly in-the-money strike price.\n\t\u2022\tPros: High leverage and high reward if NVDA\u2019s stock rallies.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Risk of losing the premium paid if the stock doesn\u2019t rise enough.\n\n2. Bull Call Spread (Moderate Bullish)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Traders with a bullish outlook but seeking to reduce upfront cost and risk.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Buy a call at a lower strike price and sell another call at a higher strike price.\n\t\u2022\tPros: Limits loss to the net premium paid and reduces cost compared to buying a single call.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Caps the upside profit potential.\n\n3. Cash-Secured Put (Moderately Bullish, Income-Generating)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Traders who are bullish on NVDA and want to own the stock at a lower price.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Sell a put option at a strike price you\u2019re willing to buy NVDA stock.\n\t\u2022\tPros: Generates premium income; you acquire NVDA stock at a discount if assigned.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Requires cash reserves to secure the put and potential for the stock to drop below the strike price.\n\n4. Iron Condor (Neutral, Volatility-Based)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Traders expecting NVDA stock to trade in a range with reduced volatility.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Sell a bull put spread and a bear call spread, with strikes bracketing the anticipated price range.\n\t\u2022\tPros: Limited risk and reward; benefits from reduced volatility and time decay.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Requires accurate prediction of NVDA\u2019s price range; low reward-to-risk ratio.\n\n5. Protective Put (Defensive)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Investors holding NVDA stock who want to hedge against downside risk.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Buy a put option below the current stock price.\n\t\u2022\tPros: Protects against significant downside while retaining upside potential.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Costly premium, especially given NVDA\u2019s current volatility.\n\n6. Covered Call (Neutral to Mildly Bullish, Income-Generating)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Traders with NVDA shares looking to generate income from stagnant or mildly bullish price action.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Hold NVDA shares and sell a call option at a higher strike price.\n\t\u2022\tPros: Earn premium income and retain potential for modest gains in stock price.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Limits upside if NVDA rallies significantly above the strike price.\n\n7. Straddle or Strangle (Volatility Play)\n\n\t\u2022\tBest For: Traders expecting significant movement in NVDA stock but uncertain of the direction.\n\t\u2022\tStrategy: Buy a call and a put option with the same expiration (straddle) or different strike prices (strangle).\n\t\u2022\tPros: High reward potential in volatile scenarios.\n\t\u2022\tCons: Expensive premiums, requiring substantial movement to be profitable.\n\nRanking Summary (Best to Worst):\n\n\t1.\tLong Call Options (High leverage for aggressive bull case).\n\t2.\tBull Call Spread (Balanced bullish approach with reduced cost).\n\t3.\tCash-Secured Put (Great for income and potential stock ownership).\n\t4.\tIron Condor (Neutral play for range-bound expectations).\n\t5.\tProtective Put (Defensive, for existing stockholders).\n\t6.\tCovered Call (Income-generating, suitable for minimal price movement).\n\t7.\tStraddle/Strangle (Best for extreme volatility scenarios).\n\nRecommendation: Choose a strategy based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. NVDA\u2019s high volatility and AI-driven growth suggest focusing on bullish strategies like bull call spreads or cash-secured puts for balanced risk/re",

I was intrigued and watch-listed it at 5.45/con. I have enough in my play account to get 10 of them. I then promptly forgot all about it until the election and saw how Leon was buddy buddy with L'Orange and that my TSLA calls were up to well over 100/con. \n\nAround this same time I saw the ACHR DD and watch-listed the $5 calls at 0.13/con which have now exploded. \n\nIt's a very fair argument to say I may not have held for max gains.

            "A contract (option) is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock. So when you buy an option, all you\u2019re doing is buying the right (or option) to buy 100 shares of that stock at a set price. It gives you leverage of 100 shares without owning any. The price you pay for the option is the premium. Basically how much you\u2019re will to pay to have the right to buy 100 shares. \n\nI can bet that almost no one on WSB eventually gets those 100 shares, they wait until the premium for the right to buy those 100 shares goes up and then sell those rights to someone else for profit. \n\nSay stock B is currently $20, we buy a call for months out with a strike price of $25. Maybe we pay $100 for the option. Stock B eventually goes up to $30. We currently have the right to buy 100 shares at $25 ($5 less than the current price). So we would be able to make $500 right now if we exercised and sold the shares, but there is still 1 month until it expires, there will also be additional value added on due to the prospect that it could go up more. \n\nThere are different Greeks that will give you all the technical information of an option. Delta will tell you how much the premium will increase for every $1 move of the stock. Say Delta is .40, our stock went up $10 total so our premium would have gone up 4.00 or $400 plus the additional premium from the prospect of it going up more.\n\nSo we bought the call for $100, stock went up $10 and that added $400 more in value, plus another $100 for the prospect of it going up more. We now sell it for $600 to someone else who thinks it will go up more. We x6 our money. If we bought 10 contracts to start, our original investment would have been $1,000, and we would have sold for $6,000. \n\nSorry if that doesn\u2019t answer your question, there are a bunch of different things that go into it, Delta, Theta, IV etc. but the basics would be leverage of 100 shares, time until expiration and speculation of it going up or down plus what people are willing to pay for it. \n\nOne thing to be careful of is crazy high premiums, an option could be selling for $600 but only be valued at $400-$500, it all depends on what the seller sets a price for, some do market value and some set it crazy high. Always check what the bids are to make sure it\u2019s not way over priced. Other \u201crules\u201d I try to follow are never play earnings. You can make stupid BANK (posts you see on here lmao), but the chances are slim and I\u2019ve been burned too many times. Netflix earnings a couple weeks ago, both weekly calls and puts were down 40%-60% due to how things happened. Also, as I mentioned above I buy options 3-6 months out. Weeklies are cheaper because there is only a few days for the stock price to go up. But stock market is crazy some times it can go up and down day by day, if I believe a stock will go up in the long run, it is just safer. Example: you could be right that price will go up in 4 months, but it dropped 10% this week. So, the weekly call expired worthless (you lost all your money) instead of it going down a little and back up. \n\nI look at it like this, Longer calls = investing strategy to take advantage of leverage, weeklies = gambling (make a shit ton or nothing). You can make money using both. One is \u201csafer\u201d, although, you can lose all your money either way lmao if you\u2019re interested in them I would do more research than my half ass explanation. They can be complicated and easy to get burned on. But also are a great way to use leverage to make $$$.",
            "Yes but you also lose money as it gets closer to the expiration date. If you its worth 10 dollars and it hits 10 dollars sell it. Time is money with options. It\u2019s a dance between time and value.",

            "You can\u2019t undo it lol only sell it. What platform are you on and what are the details of the position (stock, strike, expiration date)? \n\nThere should be a button that says \u201ctrade\u201d or something similar when viewing your position which will give you the option to sell. If it\u2019s down you can sell to try and recoup some losses and if it\u2019s up you can sell for a profit. Most bids will be slightly below the current value, if you just want to offload it as quick as possible you can sell it for the bid price or do a market sell. Might be a little less than what you could get, but it will be immediate.\n\nIf you hold onto it until expiration the value will go to $0. You won\u2019t be forced to exercise and buy 100 shares. You\u2019ll just lose all the money you put in lmao"

            "software can be - and is all the time - upgraded remotely on satellites. Assessing this depends on the cost model, at 85x the fleet size it depends how many you launch in one go and for what price.\n\nedit: SpaceX launches between 20 and 60 satellites per launch, 10% of which will not work and just be decommissioned shortly.\n\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 launch costs about $7mil ($116k per sat), whereas Starship costs around $100mil. Falcon 9 can launch up to 60 sats, Starship I'm not sure, I've read estimates from 50 all the way up to 600 sats. If we use a conservative 150 sats per launch on Starship the cost per sat is $600k, so a fully loaded Falcon 9 would still be cheaper, Starship only competes if it can launch 600+ sats per launch or reduce the cost per launch.\n\nSo with Falcon 9's it costs $886mil to put up the whole fleet, or renew the whole fleet.\n\nASTS says they spend $20mil per launch putting a sat up so it's $1.8B to put up or renew their whole fleet.\n\nSince Starlink has a 1 year lifespan vs 10 years, we're looking at $9.75B after 11 years for SpaceX vs $3.6B for ASTS, but in that period of time ASTS has a much older fleet on average.\n\nI have a lot of confidence that SpaceX can narrow this projected $9.75B after 11 years by a lot simply by slightly increasing the lifespan of the sats once the hardware is more stable as well as reducing costs of Starship launches when they are doing multiple a day as is their goal. i also didn't include the 10% fleet malfunction rate for SpaceX because I didn't have a number for ASTS.\n\nInteresting stuff, I was writing this to myself so why not share",
            "Starlink also has the best seats in the house for LEO communication. Which is a big advantage because if other companies get less-ideal spots (higher up in orbit) that means they will always have more latency than Starlink simply due to the laws of physics (speed of light. Nothing they can do to mitigate/fix it). I'd yolo everything I have into a Starlink IPO.",

But eventually, old hardware becomes antiquated - software gets more bloated and even a machine that used to do well enough becomes a clunker. It's just the nature of the software development cycle.\n\nGoofy examples\n\nAdobe used to be a few hundred kilobytes of data. Today, a full install can reach over 4 Gigs. \n\nYou would need the most powerful computer on earth in 1980 to run photoshop today.\n\nIn 2024, a single NVDA gaming card (The ones you get at Best Buy, not the new AI stuff) has more computational power than every computer (private and government) on 1980s earth.",
            "The $100mil figure for Starship is if it's entirely expanded. The real number will be far far lower than that. They aim for sub $2mil with only the fuel and operational costs being relevant for the fully reusable version. But I will increase that tenfold to $20mil. And that's for being able to lift almost 10 times as much as the Falcon 9 and have the volume to lift the much more capable Starlink 2 satellites. I have also read the internal costs is more around $15mil for a Falcon 9 launch with the cost of building the second stage and refurbishing of the booster included. So you can expect at least it becoming 5 times cheaper to launch with Starship. 50 times if their costs goal is actually reached (which I doubt).",

Part 15 has this whole bit about not interfering with other electronic devices and also not being dangerous when exposed to emissions.\u00a0\n\n\nAnyways, satellites are far away and you need to emit signals strongly to reach them. The antennas a lot of phones certify with are also not often intended to broadcast to those satellites directly, but with some electronics and firmware planning you might be able to broadcast to it. This would be a different spectrum than your device was intended to radiate emissions on and would need new certifications.",

Top of the line, cutting edge, 3G capability.\n\nLiterally 5 years later, they would be borderline useless due to not having the bandwidth needed to transmit 4G data streams. Another 5 years after that, completely useless, as 5G would completely overwhelm their technical capabilities.\n\nFFS, there was a time when going from 28.8kbps modems to 56.6kpbs was considered amazing progress.\n\nIn the early 1990s, a business would pay **$10,000 a month** for a T1 **1.5Mbps** connection\n\nToday, I pay around **$200** a month for 2 Gigabits (**2,000Mbps**).\n\nIt's all good.

Investors are cautiously eyeing inflation data and potential market volatility headed into the holiday season.\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Top Stock Plays**:  \n- **$DELL**: \ud83d\udc94 Missed revenue despite strong EPS. Down 7% post-earnings. Bears are targeting further downturns; puts are set to print.  \n- **$CRWD**: \ud83d\udcc9 Bullish outlook turned sour with a 4% drop after strong earnings, signaling weak future guidance. Watch for recovery potential.  \n- **$MSTR**: \ud83d\ude80 Rollercoaster ride; bulls are hopeful after AH bounce, but previous losses weigh heavily. Still, speculative interest remains high.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 **Rising Stars**:  \n- **$ACHR**: \ud83d\ude81 Buzzing with new attention. Potential for short-term gains as speculation grows about upcoming developments in electric air taxis.  \n- **$RKLB**: \ud83d\ude80 Upward momentum has garnered bullish sentiment. Short-term traders eyeing profits following tech advances. \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 **Hidden Gems**:  \n- **$LUNR**: \ud83c\udf0c Gaining interest with recent spikes, signaling potential as space exploration stocks draw moods.  \n- **$PDYN**: \ud83d\udcc8 Already seeing impressive gains; low risk for quick ROI if the momentum continues.\n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 **Forecast & Actionable Insights**:  \n\ud83d\udcca **Trend Watching**: Expect volatility as PCE data drops before the market opens. Tighten your stops if holding growth stocks and consider scaling into $SPY puts if bearish sentiment rises. Diversify with a portion in $ACHR and $RKLB for potential swings.

The issue isn't even with the bond buyers as those notes are basically cheap call options.  The issue is going to be with copycats and yield chasing bond fund managers.  You'll have fund managers that will underperform if they don't have this type of exposure so they'll scoop some of these up.  This is round 1 though.  What asset spawns the next convertible wave?  Things might go well for bit but then you'll have some sort of failure where that paper gets nuked and the bond funds (bond funds grandma and the Bogleheads are investing in for safety) take heavy losses and the selling cascades.  Bond markets precede the stock market so it's probably time for people in this sub to start watching it if you eventually want to time your puts.",

            "Shitcoin ICOs and options have been present in crypto since 2017. I don't believe legitimate businesses will get involved with any kind of scheme unless it's BTC/ETH within the next few years.\n\nIn your analogy, I don't believe MSTR/bond holders are reselling debt. MSTR (mortgage lender) fund homes (BTC) on low equity (but high premium) bonds in rising BTC market ***because*** bond buyers have shorted BTC/MSTR and are looking for a way to hedge position via leveraged instrument (high premium bond) over long term (4+ years). Yes, this will likely force BTC upward like home prices and then MSTR as a result, which increases likelihood of MSTR selling more bonds (as shorts have to hedge more as a result).\n\nProcess seems to be:\n\n1. Eventual bond holder first sells call options/shorts MSTR/BTC.\n2. MSTR beginning at low/no premium to NAV *eventually* starts increasing in value.\n3. MSTR having favorable conditions for stock appreciation (increase in volatility/increase in assets held) due to options activity and BTC market, sees there is market to sell low interest bonds and increase asset base via high premium for shorts to hedge their bets (they do not appear to sell bonds during bear markets when stock price and premium are low).\n4. MSTR stock gamma squeeze as shorts from #1 buy high premium long-dated bonds to cover positions.\n5. Time goes on and eventually BTC enters bear market, MSTR price drops, and stock value trends back towards NAV.\n6. Shorts make money from their expired options/short shares while collecting senior shares at lower price in MSTR as a result of hedge.\n\nThe big losers are people buying MSTR stock at heights and selling during bear. The big winners are the long-term shorts, short-term longs, and MSTR for increasing its asset base.\n\nIf BTC takes off within 4 years, shorts have covered with premium from MSTR position for small gains (bond premium + MSTR stock value >= interest + loss on short) and holders of BTC/MSTR are doing great. If BTC falls anytime in next 2-3 years, shorts have options expire worthless and make bank - they get shares in diluted MSTR stock for next potential run-up while BTC/MSTR bulls get hammered.\n\nI don't know how many fund managers would be chasing yield if the above is correct. The mortgage writer (MSTR) and owner (of bond) are both benefitting regardless in above situation, only losers are those owning MSTR during dilution (bear market) and those buying high (during bull market).",

Or employ a friend's kid, and then have your kid employed by your friend's charity. Or do this with even more intermediaries trading favours. Another is to trade other kind of favours, your charity will buy some good or service from your friend (solar panels if your friend make solar panels) to give to whoever as a charity, in exchange your friend will buy from you, employ your kid's wife, gift you something you can resell, etc...   \nThose are simple to understand schemes buy you can buy anything with favours transactions, it's like money transactions but it's not taxed, not VAT, no income tax.",

            "That probably isn't why though just a convenient excuse.\n\nHis personal behavior doesn't impact how good he is as a philanthropist.  And Buffett certainly doesn't care that much if CEOs are accused of similar shit.  He will invest.",
            "I think you\u2019re confused. \n\n60% is the limit of your income that you can take charitable deductions on. That doesn\u2019t mean you get 60% back. For example, if you make 100k a year you could give away 60k. That would then deduct what income taxes you paid on that 60k. So let\u2019s say that works out to 20k.\n\nYou just gave away 60k to get 20k back, meaning you\u2019re still down 40k. \n\nHe could just directly employ family members. \n\nThere are limits on gifts - only $18,000 per year or something like 13 million over your lifetime.  That includes items, not just cash.",
            "I think he means by their standards. They\u2019re probably used to private planes, 5 star hotels, personal chefs and whatnot.",
            "Yeah, except he didn\u2019t hand over dollars to anyone else through his years EXCEPT for long time friend Gates. Gates kinda broke that trust with whatever he did. \n\nYou can downvote me all you like but the situation with Gates changed quite a bit, leading to his divorce and resignation from many places including the Berkshire board. Again, I\u2019m not commenting on whether it was his plan all along to not give Gates money, I\u2019m just saying I get why he withdrew.",
            "I don't know for USA, didn't find these 25% you talk about. But in France you get 66% of the donated amount back. There are ways to get around gift limits, gift in other countries, advantageous transaction like buying a painting worth 1 million for 5 million, paying someone 1 million to speak, to show up, or to give his opinion privately, etc...",
            "Exactly my point - the dude is so out of touch it\u2019s not funny, and yet claims incessantly to \u201clive a humble life\u201d. Give me a friggen break old man.",
            "Call me naive, but I don't think Buffett spoils his kids the way most rich people do.",
            "What happens with Gates? Is there any info you can link?",
            "I get it.  But when you step back and look at the total inconsistency of his actions and how rational he is with his investing, it's obvious at least to me that you are going out of your way to defend him.\n\nLet's agree to disagree though.  Cheers."

Meaning they acquired 60% more bitcoin for each shareholder per share owned, and that's including fully assumed dilution from their convertible notes.\n\nSure you may start out with 0.3 or 0.4 btc exposure to their btc (per dollar invested), but you're buying a machine that perpetually delivers you more btc on your invested capital. That's completely ignoring the compounded gains from appreciation. \n\nAs opposed to just buying the bitcoin on your own and that's it.\n\nThat's why they trade at a 2-3 multiple of NAV. Now think of the multiples of some other companies that are growing at 60% annually.",

            "Nope, they can both go to zero.\n\nKidding. It's a genuine question. The theory is, MSTR's debt is long term, so they'll have the time to wait for BTC to rebound before needing to pay it back. An individual investor would just be wiped out by the leverage immediately if BTC dropped.\n\nThe reality is, 1) some of MSTR's debt is puttable, meaning the bondholder can request the issuer to buy back the bond. This provides downside protection if the bond's value decreases due to MSTR balance sheet weakness, and MSTR would be required to sell BTC at the lows to meet this obligation. 2) There are still bonds with principal payments due over the next few years, and MSTR does not have the cash to meet these payments today. They bought BTC instead. They would need to dilute or take out more debt, and that would be very difficult in a crypto winter environment.\n\nThere's risks to long MSTR that aren't there with long leveraged BTC.",
            "The biggest risk is that unless you\u2019re very rich, your own margin position could very easily get shaken out in a downturn whereas mstr can hold on for longer.

            "[The latest evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kraken/comments/1dv3myf/kraken_fees_on_leverage/) I can find says about .01% every 4 hours, adding to .04% a day, which would be about 14.6% a year. It's based on the initial dollar value of the investment, so if you bought 1 BTC at 20k, you'd pay 2,920 a year in fees.\n\nBut you ask a good question, and I was really curious about how this impacts the hypothetical situation above, so I did the math.\n\n1.6B BTC at 5.6x leverage is about 9B of bitcoin. You'd pay about 1.314B in fees a year. After 2 years (Dec 2022 to Dec 2024), you pay about 2.6B in fees. This changes the final gain from about 51B to 48.4B, a 2925%\u00a0increase instead of 3,106, which does significantly change the gain. However, you're still far ahead of the 2453% gain in MSTR over the same time period.\n\nHope this helped.",
